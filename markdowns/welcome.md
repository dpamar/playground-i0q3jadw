playgrounds if you didn't already !

The goal of this playground is to explain how to have funky outputs : bold, blinking, underlined, colored, ...

Yes, this is possible with BF !!!

_Note 1_: Actually, this is possible with any command line application on Bash

_Note 2_: Yes, this is about a Bash feature (or any shell that supports ANSI/VT100 control sequences)
